two essential components of a recursive function
  1. base case - condition when the recursion ends
  2. different input

common recursion pitfalls
  1. incorrect base case
  2. forgetting to return things
  3. stack overflow

pure recursion
  stand alone function that doesnt depend on external data structures
  when making copies of arrays, use slice, spread operator, or concat to avoid mutation
