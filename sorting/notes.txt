elementary sorting algorithms
  javascripts built in sort - sorts by unicode unless given a comparative function
  bubble sort
    not commonly used, inefficient
    largest values bubbles to the top/end
    O(n^2)
  selection sort
    similar to bubble sort, swaps smallest value to start
    O(n^2)
  insertion sort
    inserts next value into correct spot
