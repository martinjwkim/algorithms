data structures
  collection of values and relationships between them
  have functions and operations that can be applied to the data in it

Singly Linked List
  DESCRIPTION
    distinction between linked list and array - linked list doesnt have any indeces
      cons - cant access random index
      pros - insertion and deletion is inexpensive since values dont have to be reindexed
    has nodes, which has both a value and pointer to the next node
    contains a head, tail, and length
    connected in a single direction to the next node
  BIG O COMPLEXITY
    insertion O(1) doesnt matter where the insertion is
    removal O(N) depends on where the removal is
    searching O(N)
    access O(N) where arrays are O(1)
  RECAP
    better than arrays when insertion and deletion are required at the beginning
    worse than arrays when random access is required

Doubly Linked List
  DESCRIPTION
    distinction between dll and sll
      every node has a previous node pointer
      more flexibility but uses more memory
