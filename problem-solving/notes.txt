PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH
  1. understand the problem
    - restate the problem in your own words
    - consider the inputs going in to the problem
    - consider the outputs / what should the solution look like
    - how should i label the important pieces of data
  2. explore examples
    - examples make you think of different cases
    - start with simple examples
    - progress to more complex examples
    - explore examples with empty inputs and invalid inputs
  3. break it down
    - write out the steps you need to take
    - pseudocode
  4. solve and simplify
    - find the difficult part of the problem and ignore it
    - write a simplified version
    - incorporate the difficulty back in
  5. look back and refactor
    - think of another way to solve the problem with better time/space complexity
    - can ask interviewer how other people have solved the problem
